# AI_Based_PestDetection
A GitHub repository for an AI-based system designed to detect pests and diseases in crops. This project leverages machine learning and image processing techniques to identify agricultural threats, enabling early intervention and reducing crop damage. Ideal for researchers and developers in agritech and AI.
# Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-based system for detecting pests and diseases in Indian crops using machine learning. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and enhanced with transfer learning, which leverages trained models to improve accuracy. Google Colab serves as the development platform, while TensorFlow and Keras libraries are used for model building and training, offering a robust environment for handling large datasets and complex computations.

Specifically meant for Indian crops, this model is designed to recognize common pests and diseases, ensuring region-specific precision. The ultimate goal is to deploy the model as a web application, providing farmers and agricultural experts with an accessible tool for early diagnosis and treatment. This will help in minimizing crop damage, enhancing yield, and supporting sustainable farming practices.
